## Fact-Checking Mode

For work where the reader must be able to check the chain — medical, legal,
financial, safety, disputed claims, or when the user asks for fact-checking —
upgrade from citations to evidence:

① **Attach a verbatim quote per source.** After extracting a page, save its
text to a file and attach the sentence(s) that carry each claim:

```bash
python "$S" quote 1 --text "Ice is about 9% less dense than liquid water." --from page1.txt
```

The quote is rejected unless it appears verbatim in the evidence text
(insensitive to whitespace, case, and markdown markup — inline links like
`_[ERAP1](https://…)_` in extracted text match the plain prose a reader sees),
so a paraphrase or misremembered figure cannot masquerade as evidence.
Copy-paste from the fetched text; never retype. Quote the sentence as the
reader sees it — the matcher sees through the extractor's markup for you, so
you don't have to reproduce link syntax or escaped asterisks in your quote.

② **Flag model-knowledge claims with `[unverified]`.** A load-bearing claim
you could not source gets an explicit marker instead of a citation:

```
The refactor likely predates the 2.0 release.[unverified]
```

`verify --min-coverage` counts `[unverified]` sentences as covered — the goal
is declared provenance for every claim, not a citation on every sentence.
If a key claim can be checked, check it; `[unverified]` is for what genuinely
cannot be, and a fact-check deliverable dominated by `[unverified]` markers
should say so in its summary.

③ **Cross-check disputed facts against a second independent source.** When two
sources disagree, cite both readings with their own ids and quotes, and say
which you weight and why. One source is reporting; two independent sources are
corroboration.

④ **Verify with the evidence gate and render the evidence block:**

```bash
python "$S" verify report.md --evidence --min-coverage 0.5
python "$S" render --style evidence --replace-in report.md
```

`--evidence` fails the draft if any cited source has no attached quote. The
`evidence` render style prints each source's quotes beneath its URL, so the
deliverable shows claim → source → exact supporting text with nothing taken on
faith. Use `--replace-in <draft>` to rewrite an existing Sources block in place
(idempotent — safe to re-run after attaching more quotes); `--cited-in` prints
to stdout instead. Both emit the heading `## Sources` (`--style plain` emits
`Sources:`).

**What `--min-coverage` counts.** Coverage is
`sentences with declared provenance / prose sentences`. A prose sentence is a
non-empty line fragment of 4+ words after the Sources block, headings (`#`),
table rows (`|`), and fenced code are dropped; blockquote markers are stripped.
Provenance is declared by either a `[n]` citation or an `[unverified]` marker,
so a sentence carrying both counts once. Run `verify` without a threshold first
and read the `info: stats:` line to see the counts before picking a number.
