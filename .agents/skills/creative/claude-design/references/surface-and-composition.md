# Surface And Composition

_Moved verbatim out of SKILL.md so the trigger body stays small._

## Surface-First: Commit to a Composition Before Touching Tokens

The single highest-leverage anti-slop rule. Most AI design slop is **compositional, not cosmetic** — the model reaches for a centered hero + three equal-weight feature cards for *every* surface, then decorates. Recoloring or restyling that layout never fixes it, because the layout was wrong before a single color was chosen.

Before you write any colors, type scale, or components, **commit out loud to exactly one surface archetype.** This conditions generation on a high-level plan first, which collapses the entropy of what gets produced — the same reason a chain-of-thought step improves reasoning.

The seven surfaces:

1. **Monitor** — the user is watching state change (dashboards, status pages, observability). Density, glanceable hierarchy, no marketing framing.
2. **Operate** — the user is taking action on things (consoles, admin panels, queues, inboxes). Action affordances and selection state dominate.
3. **Compare** — the user is weighing options against each other (pricing, plans, spec tables, search results). Aligned columns, parity of structure, one differentiator emphasized.
4. **Configure** — the user is setting things up (settings, forms, wizards, onboarding). Progressive disclosure, clear save/validation states, low decoration.
5. **Decide / Learn** — the user is being convinced or taught (landing pages, docs, marketing). One idea lands per section; this is the ONLY surface where a hero is usually correct.
6. **Explore** — the user is browsing an open space (galleries, maps, search-and-filter, catalogs). Filters, result grids, and zoom/peek are the composition.
7. **Command / Inspect** — the user is driving by keyboard or drilling into one object (command bars, inspectors, detail panes, property editors). Speed and focus over breadth.

Rules:

- State the surface in one line before designing (e.g. "This is a **Monitor** surface, so density and glanceability beat a hero").
- A dashboard is a Monitor surface, not a Decide surface — do not give it a centered hero and three feature cards.
- If a screen genuinely spans two surfaces, name the **primary** one and treat the other as secondary; do not average them into mush.
- The hero-plus-three-cards composition is correct for **Decide/Learn only**. Reaching for it anywhere else is the #1 tell.

This one constraint eliminates more generic-looking UI than any aesthetic rule below.
