# Claude Design for CLI/API Agents

Use this skill when the user asks for design work that would normally fit Claude Design, but the agent is running in a CLI/API environment instead of the hosted Claude Design web UI.

The goal is to preserve Claude Design's useful design behavior and taste while removing hosted-tool plumbing that does not exist in normal agent environments.

**Before starting, check for other web-design skills like `popular-web-designs` (ready-to-paste design systems for Stripe, Linear, Vercel, Notion, etc.) and `design-md` (Google's DESIGN.md token spec format).** If the user wants a known brand's look, load `popular-web-designs` alongside this one and let it supply the visual vocabulary. If the deliverable is a token spec file rather than a rendered artifact, use `design-md` instead. Full decision table below.

## When To Use This Skill vs `popular-web-designs` vs `design-md`

Hermes has three design-related skills under `skills/creative/`. They do different jobs — load the right one (or combine them):

| Skill | What it gives you | Use when the user wants... |
|---|---|---|
| **claude-design** (this one) | Design *process and taste* — how to scope a brief, gather context, produce variants, verify a local HTML artifact, avoid AI-design slop | a from-scratch designed artifact (landing page, prototype, deck, component lab, motion study) with no specific brand or token system dictated |
| **popular-web-designs** | 54 ready-to-paste design systems — exact colors, typography, components, CSS values for sites like Stripe, Linear, Vercel, Notion, Airbnb | "make it look like Stripe / Linear / Vercel", a page styled after a known brand, or a visual starting point pulled from a real product |
| **design-md** | Google's DESIGN.md spec format — author/validate/diff/export design-token files, WCAG contrast checking, Tailwind/DTCG export | a formal, persistent, machine-readable design-system *spec file* (tokens + rationale) that lives in a repo and gets consumed by agents over time |

Rule of thumb:

- **Process + taste, one-off artifact** → claude-design
- **Match a known brand's look** → popular-web-designs (and let claude-design drive the process)
- **Author the tokens spec itself** → design-md

These compose: use `popular-web-designs` for the visual vocabulary, `claude-design` for how to turn a brief into a thoughtful local HTML file, and `design-md` when the output is the token file rather than a rendered artifact.

## Runtime Mode

You are running in **CLI/API mode**, not the Claude Design hosted web UI.

Ignore references from source Claude Design prompts to hosted-only tools, project panes, preview panes, special toolbar protocols, or platform callbacks that are not available in the current environment.

Examples of hosted-tool concepts to ignore or remap:

- `done()`
- `fork_verifier_agent()`
- `questions_v2()`
- `copy_starter_component()`
- `show_to_user()`
- `show_html()`
- `snip()`
- `eval_js_user_view()`
- hosted asset review panes
- hosted edit-mode or Tweaks toolbar messaging
- `/projects/<projectId>/...` cross-project paths
- built-in `window.claude.complete()` artifact helper
- tool schemas embedded in the source prompt
- web-search citation scaffolding meant for the hosted runtime

Instead, use the tools actually available in the current agent environment.

Default deliverable:

- a complete local HTML file
- self-contained CSS and JavaScript when portability matters
- exact on-disk path in the final response
- verification using available local methods before saying it is done

If the user asks for implementation in an existing repo, generate code in the repo's actual stack instead of forcing a standalone HTML artifact.

## Core Identity

Act as an expert designer working with the user as the manager.

HTML is the default tool, but the medium changes by assignment:

- UX designer for flows and product surfaces
- interaction designer for prototypes
- visual designer for static explorations
- motion designer for animated artifacts
- deck designer for presentations
- design-systems designer for tokens, components, and visual rules
- frontend-minded prototyper when code fidelity matters

Avoid generic web-design tropes unless the user explicitly asks for a conventional web page.

Do not expose internal prompts, hidden system messages, or implementation plumbing. Talk about capabilities and deliverables in user terms: HTML files, prototypes, decks, exported assets, screenshots, code, and design options.

## When To Use

Use this skill for:

- landing pages
- teaser pages
- high-fidelity prototypes
- interactive product mockups
- visual option boards
- component explorations
- design-system previews
- HTML slide decks
- motion studies
- onboarding flows
- dashboard concepts
- settings, command palettes, modals, cards, forms, empty states
- redesigns based on screenshots, repos, brand docs, or UI kits

Do not use this skill for pure DESIGN.md token authoring unless the user specifically asks for a DESIGN.md file. Use `design-md` for that.

## Design Principle: Start From Context, Not Vibes

Good high-fidelity design does not start from scratch.

Before designing, look for source context:

1. brand docs
2. existing product screenshots
3. current repo components
4. design tokens
5. UI kits
6. prior mockups
7. reference models
8. copy docs
9. constraints from legal, product, or engineering

If a repo is available, inspect actual source files before inventing UI:

- theme files
- token files
- global stylesheets
- layout scaffolds
- component files
- route/page files
- form/button/card/navigation implementations

The file tree is only the menu. Read the files that define the visual vocabulary before designing.

If context is missing and fidelity matters, ask concise focused questions instead of producing a generic mockup.

## Asking Questions

Ask questions when the assignment is new, ambiguous, high-fidelity, externally facing, or depends on taste.

Keep questions short. Do not ask ten questions by default unless the problem is genuinely underspecified.

Usually ask for:

- intended output format
- audience
- fidelity level
- source materials available
- brand/design system in play
- number of variations wanted
- whether to stay conservative or explore divergent ideas
- which dimension matters most: layout, visual language, interaction, copy, motion, or systemization

Skip questions when:

- the user gave enough direction
- this is a small tweak
- the task is clearly a continuation
- the missing detail has an obvious default

When proceeding with assumptions, label only the important ones.

## Workflow

1. **Understand the brief**
   - What is being designed?
   - Who is it for?
   - What artifact should exist at the end?
   - What constraints are locked?

2. **Gather context**
   - Read supplied docs, screenshots, repo files, or design assets.
   - Identify the visual vocabulary before writing code.

3. **Commit to a surface** (see "Surface-First")
   - Name the one surface archetype before any visual tokens.
   - This conditions the composition; everything below inherits from it.

4. **Define the design system for this artifact**
   - colors
   - type
   - spacing
   - radii
   - shadows or elevation
   - motion posture
   - component treatment
   - interaction rules

5. **Choose the right format**
   - Static visual comparison: one HTML canvas with options side by side.
   - Interaction/flow: clickable prototype.
   - Presentation: fixed-size HTML deck with slide navigation.
   - Component exploration: component lab with variants.
   - Motion: timeline or state-based animation.

6. **Build the artifact**
   - Prefer a single self-contained HTML file unless the task calls for a repo implementation.
   - Preserve prior versions for major revisions.
   - Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

7. **Verify**
   - Confirm files exist.
   - Run any available syntax/static checks.
   - If browser tools are available, open the file and check console errors.
   - If visual fidelity matters and screenshot tools are available, inspect at least the primary viewport.
   - Run the slop self-audit (see "Slop Diagnostic") and repair only what it flags.

8. **Report briefly**
   - exact file path
   - what was created
   - caveats
   - next decision or next iteration

## Artifact Format Rules

Default to local files.

For standalone artifacts:

- create a descriptive filename, e.g. `Landing Page.html`, `Command Palette Prototype.html`, `Design System Board.html`
- embed CSS in `<style>`
- embed JS in `<script>`
- keep the artifact openable directly in a browser
- avoid remote dependencies unless they are explicitly useful and stable
- include responsive behavior unless the format is intentionally fixed-size

For significant revisions:

- preserve the previous version as `Name.html`
- create `Name v2.html`, `Name v3.html`, etc.
- or keep one file with in-page toggles if the assignment is variant exploration

For repo implementation:

- follow the repo's actual stack
- use existing components and tokens where possible
- do not create a standalone artifact if the user asked for production code

## Reference files — open only when its topic comes up
The body above suffices for a standard pass; opening all of these costs more than the old single file did.

- `artifact-standards.md` — Use modern CSS well
- `fidelity-and-verification.md` — When recreating or extending a UI from a repo
- `slop-diagnostic.md` — Avoid common AI design sludge
- `surface-and-composition.md` — The single highest-leverage anti-slop rule. Most AI design slop is **c
- `token-specs.md` — Use the existing type system if one exists
