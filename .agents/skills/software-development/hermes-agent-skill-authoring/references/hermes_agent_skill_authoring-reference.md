## Decide the Tier First: Bundled vs Optional

- **Bundled (`skills/<category>/`)** — daily-driver behavior, broadly useful across many user types, low footprint. Hard bar: you can say "a user will load this in 5+ sessions per month" with a straight face.
- **Optional (`optional-skills/<category>/`)** — niche, vertical-specific (blockchain, gaming, finance, one app), recurring-job/task skills, or anything heavy. Installed via `hermes skills install official/<category>/<skill>`.

**When in doubt, optional.** Promoting later is easy; demoting is churn. "Would be useful to anyone who ever needs this" is an optional-tier argument, not a bundled one.

Pick the category by what the tool IS, not what it feels like (an AI-agent CLI goes in `autonomous-ai-agents/` even if it "feels productivity"). Confirm existing categories with `search_files(pattern='*', target='files', path='skills')` and don't invent new top-level categories casually.

**No router / index / hub skills.** A skill whose core content is a routing table pointing at sibling skills adds an indirection hop and duplicates the siblings' own `When to Use` triggers. If the skill would be empty without "load skill X instead" pointers, don't write it — the catalog and each sibling's triggers already do that job.

## Required Frontmatter

Validator source of truth: `tools/skill_manager_tool.py::_validate_frontmatter`. Validator hard requirements:

- Starts with `---` as the first bytes (no leading blank line).
- Closes with `\n---\n` before the body.
- Parses as a YAML mapping.
- `name` field present.
- `description` field present (validator ceiling 1024 chars — but see the repo hardline below, which is much stricter).
- Non-empty body after the closing `---`.

Repo-standard shape (all fields expected, even where the validator doesn't enforce them):

```yaml

name: my-skill-name               # lowercase, hyphens, ≤64 chars (MAX_NAME_LENGTH)
description: Concise capability statement, under sixty chars.

```

### `description` rules (HARDLINE — the validator's 1024 is NOT the standard)

- **≤ 60 characters.** One sentence. Ends with a period.
- State the capability, not the implementation, and don't repeat the skill name.
- No marketing words ("powerful", "comprehensive", "seamless", "advanced").
- The system prompt skill index truncates at 57 chars + "..." — the trigger/capability must be self-contained in that window.
- If the description contains a `:`, wrap it in double quotes or YAML parses it as a mapping and the docs generator crashes. Quotes don't count toward the 60.

Good: `Track named companies for material news with cited digests.`
Bad: `Use when a user asks to monitor named competitors or companies for product launches, pricing changes, funding, ...` (240 chars — rejected in review)

### `author` rules

- Credit the **human first**, then "Hermes Agent" as secondary collaborator: `Ben Barclay (benbarclay), Hermes Agent`.
- Never `author: Hermes Agent` alone for contributed skills — credit the human, not the tool, even (especially) when an agent drafted the text.
- Maintainer-authored skills: `Teknium (teknium1), Hermes Agent`.

### `related_skills` rules

- Every entry must resolve to an existing **in-repo** skill in the same tree state as your PR. Do not reference skills that were only planned, live in another PR, or exist only in `~/.hermes/skills/`.
- Verify each entry: `search_files(pattern='<name>', target='files', path='skills')` (and `optional-skills/`).
